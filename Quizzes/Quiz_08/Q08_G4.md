b. `:: Tree a = Node a Tree a Tree a`\
c. `:: Hello a = Goodbye a (Hello a) (Hello a)`\
d. `:: Tree typeX = Node typeX (Tree typeX) (Tree typeX)`\
Answer: B

## 2. What is the output of this code?
```
:: BTree a = Bin (BTree a) (BTree a)
	| Tip a

foldbtree :: (a a -> a) (BTree a) -> a
foldbtree f (Tip x) = x
foldbtree f (Bin t1 t2) = f (foldbtree f t1) (foldbtree f t2)

aBTree = Bin (Bin (Bin (Tip 1) (Tip 2))(Bin (Tip 3) (Tip 4))) (Tip 5)
Start = foldbtree (+) aBTree

d. None of the above\
Correct answer: A

## 3. Which statement is wrong?
a. Both List and Array can be indexed.\
b. For Binary Search Trees (BST), the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the nodeâ€™s key.\
c. Arrays can be constructed via a constructor statement with a predicate.\
d. We change the value of a record type by using '&' or ','.\
Correct Answer: D

## 4. What is wrong with the following code?
```
Tree x = Node x (Tree x) (Tree x) (Tree x) | Poop

sumTree :: Tree x -> x | + x
sumTree Poop = 0
sumTree tree = getNode tree + sumTree (goL tree) + sumTree (goM tree) + sumTree (goR tree)
where
    getNode (Node x _ _ _) = x
    goL (Node _ l _ _ ) = l
    goM (Node _ _ m _ ) = m
    goR (Node _ _ _ r ) = r
