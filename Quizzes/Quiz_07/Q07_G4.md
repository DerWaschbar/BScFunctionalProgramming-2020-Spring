# Quiz 4 Group 2
## 1. What is the output of this code?
```
qsort [] = []
qsort [a:xs] = qsort[x \\ x <- xs | x > a] ++ [a] ++ qsort[x \\ x <- xs| x <= a]

Start = qsort [7, 6.. 1]
```

a. [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7]\
b. [-7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1]\
c. [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\
d. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\
Correct answer: C
## 2. What is the output of this code?
```
Start = merge [1..6] [2..5]
```
a. [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6]\
b. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\
c. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 5]\
d. [2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\
Correct answer: A
## 3. What is the output of this code?
```
Start = takeWhile ((>) 1000) (map ((^)3) [1..])
```
a. It will generate infinite elements\
b. It will generate finite elements\
c. It will cause heap full\
d. Runtime error\
Correct answer: B
## 4. What is the output of this code?
```
:: Point = {x :: Int, y :: Int}

Start :: [Point]
Start = [{a, b} \\ a <- [1..10] & b <- [2, 4..8]]
```

a. Compile Error\
b. [{1, 2}, {1, 4}..{10, 8}]\
c. [{1, 2}, {2, 2}..{10, 8}]\
d. [{1, 2}, {2, 4}, {3, 6}, {4, 8}]\
Correct answer: A
## 5. Which statement is wrong?

a. Merge sort is classical example for Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm\
b. Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm has three parts: Divide, Conquer, Combine\
c. Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm has two parts: Divide, Conquer\
d. In Merge Sort, we divide list into two halves, sort the two halves recursively, and then merge the sorted halves.\
Correct answer: C
