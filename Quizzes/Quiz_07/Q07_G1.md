## 1. What is the output of this code?
```
f :: (Tree a) â†’ Int
f Leaf = 0
f (Node _ l r) = (max (f l) (f r)) + 1
```
a. number of the nodes of the tree\
b. depth of the tree\
c. number of subtrees\
d. None of above\
Correct answer: B

## 2. What is the output of this code?
```
qsort [] = []
qsort [a:xs] = qsort[x \\ x <- xs | x > a] ++ [a] ++ qsort[x \\ x <- xs| x <= a]

Start = qsort [3,6..16]
```
a. [3,6,9,12,15]\
b. [16,15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3]\
c. [15,12,9,6,3]\
d. [16,15,12,9,6,3]\
Correct answer: C

## 3. Which statement is wrong?

a. Merge sort is classical example for Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm\
b. Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm has three parts: Divide, Conquer, Combine\
c. Divide and Conquer algorithmic paradigm has two parts: Divide, Conquer\
d. In Merge Sort, we divide list into two halves, sort the two halves recursively, and then merge the sorted halves.\
Correct answer: C


## 4.What is the output of this code?
```
merge :: [a] [a] -> [a] | Ord a
merge [] ys = ys
merge xs [] = xs
merge p=:[ x : xs] q=:[ y : ys]
|x <= y = [ x : merge xs q]
= [ y : merge p ys]

Start = merge [2 ,1] [4 ,1]
```
a. [1,1,2,4]\
b. [1,2,1,4]\
c. [2,4,1,1]\
d. [2,1,4,1]\
Correct answer: D

## 5. What is the output of the following code?
```
Start = iterate (\ x= x/10) 54321
```
a. [5432,543,54,5]\
b. [54321,5432,543,54,5]\
c. [5432,543,54,5,0,0,0,0...]\
d. [54321,5432,543,54,5,0,0,0,0...]\
Correct answer: D
